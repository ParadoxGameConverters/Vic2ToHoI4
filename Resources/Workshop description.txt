[h1]Vic2 To HoI4 Converter[/h1]

Welcome to the Vic2 to HoI4 Converter project! The goal of this project is to allow a Victoria 2 campaign to be transferred and continued in Hearts of Iron 4, so you may continue your game uninterrupted, from 1826 to 1950+, and further using our other converters from Crusader Kings 2 and Europa Universalis 4.

Running a continuous campaign from CK2 all the way to HoI4 is called running a [b]mega-campaign[/b].

[h2]Converter is not a mod - it is a mod producing [i]application[/i][/h2]
[list]
[*] Stable release of the converter currently supports HoI4 1.10.1 and Victoria 2 3.0.4. HoI4 DLCs are optional, both Vic2 expansions [b]are mandatory[/b].
[*] Development release of the converter is compatible with HoI4 1.10.1
[*] This mod is not intended to be enabled in game. It is only a [i]delivery vehicle[/i] for the converter's download link.
[*] You can also download the converter directly from our [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/vic2-to-hoi4-converter-release-thread.948992/]forums thread[/url] or from Github.
[/list]

[h3]Setting up the converter.[/h3]
To set up the converter, you’ll need to follow the simple steps below:
[olist]
[*] Subscribe to the this mod.
[*] If the mod does not immediately begin downloading, you may need to start HoI4 launcher to trigger the download.
[*] Go to your mod folder (usually [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steamapps\Workshop\Content\394360\733122837[/i], or elsewhere if you moved your steam library)
[*] Inside it find and open [i]downloadLink.txt[/i]. 
[*] Within that file are direct links to the converter's stable and development versions. Pick one and download it. Development versions are fresher and usually better.
[*] Unzip the downloaded converter by right-clicking on it and selecting [i]Extract All…[/i]
[*] Finally, go to the extracted converter's directory and fire it up by running [i]ConverterFrontend.exe[/i].
[/olist]

If you downloaded the converter directly from forums or github, you only need to execute steps 6 and 7.

[h2]How does it work?[/h2]
Every converter has a detailed documentation available at its [url=https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Victoria_2_to_Hearts_of_Iron_IV_converter]wiki page[/url].
Very generally, it takes your Victoria 2 [b]saved game[/b] and converts it into a Hearts of Iron 4 [b]mod[/b].
You then have to [b]enable that mod[/b] when starting HoI4 launcher:

[olist]
[*] Start the HoI4 Launcher. Click [i]Mods[/i].
[*] Click [i]Manage Mods[/i].
[*] Click [i]Initial playset[/i] and select [i]Add new playset[/i] (or select the playset you're currently using).
[*] For a fresh playset, directly select the converted mod. Otherwise, on an existing playset in the bottom right corner click [i]Add more mods[/i] and add it.
[/olist]
