 SOV_the_stalin_constitution_desc:0 "The constitution of 1924 was a good attempt at organizing a state following the Civil War, but it has served its purpose. A new constitution is needed. Primarily, we much acknowledge the tireless work of Comrade [ROOT.GetLeader] in keeping [ROOT.GetNameDef] strong and safe and whose genius and wisdom has been instrumental in leading the cause of communism forward."
 SOV_the_zinovyevite_terrorist_center:0 "The Terrorist Center"
 SOV_the_zinovyevite_terrorist_center_desc:0 "The assassination of Comrade [ROOT.UTI_sergei_kirov.GetName] in 1934 shows that there are members of the party who are clearly plotting against Comrade [ROOT.GetLeader] and [ROOT.GetNameDef] as a whole. We have obtained confessions from several co-conspirators, implicating several more people. This [ROOT.UTI_grigory_zinovyev.GetName] plot - no doubt organised by [ROOT.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName] or western agents, possibly working together - must be cut out, like a cancer, before it spreads."

 SOV_secure_the_administration_desc:0 "With the shock of the confessions of the terrorist [ROOT.UTI_grigory_zinovyev.GetName] and his allies, we must ask questions about the loyalties of other members of the party. It is imperative that we know where each member of the Politbureau stands."
 SOV_the_collectivization_process_desc:0 "While a lot of work remains to be done, and though it has been badly misshandled in some regions, the process of collectivizing the farms in [ROOT.GetNameDef] is almost complete, and will soon yield increased production from the agricultural sector."
 SOV_the_anti_soviet_trotskyist_center:0 "The Anti-[ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] Center"
 SOV_the_anti_soviet_trotskyist_center_desc:0 "Our investigation into the [ROOT.UTI_grigory_zinovyev.GetName] plot has revealed that there is a large network of anti-[ROOT.GetAdjective] terrorists in our administration. Some members are not even fully aware of who they are helping! This conspiracy must be rooted out, and drastic measures may have to be taken to achieve this."
 SOV_the_workers_dictatorship_desc:0 "All power in [ROOT.GetNameDef] must ultimately rest with the workers. We can not afford to splinter into factionalism, and must therefore ensure that the will of the workers is always expressed in the decisions of the Politbureau."

 SOV_the_military_conspiracy_desc:0 "The [ROOT.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName] plot in our country has reached the military. We now have evidence that leading Generals and even Marshalls have conspired with foreign intelligence services to overthrow the government! We can not allow officers whose loyalties are even mildly suspect to remain in positions where they can weaken our military even further."
 SOV_the_bloc_of_rights_and_trotskyites:0 "The Bloc of Rights"
 SOV_the_bloc_of_rights_and_trotskyites_desc:0 "At last, we have reached the very heart of the conspiracy in our midst. [ROOT.UTI_nikolay_bukharin.GetName] was in fact a member of the [ROOT.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName]-[ROOT.UTI_grigory_zinovyev.GetName] bloc, and was most likely the leader of the people inside the government who attempted to execute a counter-revolution. We now have irrefutable proof of this, and in one last trial, we can expose these facts to the light."
 SOV_behead_the_snake_desc:0 "It has become absolutely clear that [ROOT.GetNameDef] will not be safe until the threat of a [ROOT.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName] coup is fully banished. While it would be good to put [ROOT.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName] on trial to expose his anti-[ROOT.GetAdjective] activities, we do not have that luxury. Our only option is to assassinate him, to deprive the plot against the government of its leader and prime instigator."

 SOV_stalins_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "Following the exposure of the shocking plot against [ROOT.GetNameDef], it is obvious that it was only Comrade [ROOT.GetLeader]'s clear-sighted leadership that prevented a descent into civil war or worse. Every single [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] citizen, and indeed every member of the global working class, owes Comrade [ROOT.GetLeader] eternal gratitude for his tireless work in defending the revolution."
 SOV_they_will_know_fear_desc:0 "Our enemies have learned to fear the [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] Army and the [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] people. We have withstood the initial onslaught and it is time to fight back. We need to develop fearsome new war machines capable of breaking through even the most fortified enemy defensive lines. Such war machines must drive terror to the very heart of the enemy by merely being named..."
 SOV_inheritor_of_the_mantle_of_lenin_desc:1 "Comrade [ROOT.GetLeader] has always been Lenin's closest companion and most trusted disciple.

 SOV_the_faithful_servant_of_lenin_desc:0 "Lenin left us with the biggest task in world history: To build a society in which all people are truly equal, a society without oppression or suffering or material want. There can be no better man to execute that vision than Comrade [ROOT.GetLeader], who was with Lenin every step of the way and who now stands ready to deliver the promise that was made in the revolution."
 SOV_ban_excessive_hero_worship_desc:0 "There has been a trend of publishing fanciful and wildly exaggerated accounts of Comrade [ROOT.GetLeader]'s private life and his childhood. However well-intentioned, these accounts are counter-revolutionary and seek to establish a cult of heroism in the minds of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] people, and seeks to replace a vigorous study of the theories of Comrade [ROOT.GetLeader] with mere blind idolatry."
 SOV_leader_of_the_party_and_the_people_desc:0 "Comrade [ROOT.GetLeader] has performed his heavy tasks with dilligence and skill, and enjoys the unreserved and undivided support of both the party and the people. Any hint of vanity or self-adulation is foreign to him; he is perhaps the most humble person alive."
 SOV_great_commander_desc:0 "The accomplishments of Comrade [ROOT.GetLeader] in military theory and leadership are too many to list. While the traitor [ROOT.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName] may have founded the [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] Army, it was Comrade [ROOT.GetLeader] who turned it into an effective force to defend the accomplishments of the working class."
 SOV_architect_of_communism_desc:0 "Comrade [ROOT.GetLeader]'s unwavering commitment to the ideals of the revolution have enabled him to see the challenges of building Socialism in One Country.

 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.01.desc:0 "In a recent session of the Central Committee, Comrade [Root.GetLeader] noted the growing factionalism inside the party. While all members of the committee were quick to assure him of their full and unconditional support, this has apparently done very little to ease his concerns. According to Comrade [Root.GetLeader], we must always be vigilant for saboteurs and wreckers who plot against the state, in whatever position they may be.\n\nThis news comes as a bit of a surprise to many in the party, who believed that the threat of a party split ended with [ROOT.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName]'s exile."
 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.19.desc_1:0 "The investigation into the murder of Comrade [ROOT.UTI_sergei_kirov.GetName] in 1934 has uncovered a lot of leads that point towards a conspiracy between [ROOT.UTI_grigory_zinovyev.GetName] and [ROOT.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName]. Following a series of arrests and interrogations, the evidence has only grown more substantial. \n\nAfter a meeting with [ROOT.GetLeader], [ROOT.UTI_grigory_zinovyev.GetName] and [ROOT.UTI_lev_kamenev.GetName] have at last confessed to working with [ROOT.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName] to overthrow the government, assassinate [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] leaders and ultimately restore capitalism in [ROOT.GetNameDef]. They are now put on trial with 14 of their co-conspirators. The charges against them weigh heavy - a conviction would mean certain death."
 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.19.desc_2:0 "Following the trial of the first group of [ROOT.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName]'s terrorists, investigations by the NKVD have continued and uncovered more evidence. [ROOT.UTI_karl_radek.GetName] was arrested and eventually cracked during interrogation. He has revealed the existence of a wide-spread network of people fully or partially working with [ROOT.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName] in practically all areas of government, including the military. The ringleaders have already been arrested and confessed under interrogation.\n\nThese ringleaders, including [ROOT.UTI_karl_radek.GetName], are now on trial. Their crimes are less than the ones charged in the last trial - but the death penalty is certainly a possibility."
 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.19.desc_3:0 "The investigations before the Second [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Trial also revealed a large network of [ROOT.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName] followers in the military and upper party leadership, led by [ROOT.UTI_nikolay_bukharin.GetName]. These people have been arrested and interrogated, where they have confessed to the most serious and heinous of crimes - from planned sabotage to attempted assassination, conspiring with foreign powers and even mixing nails into butter to injure or kill regular [ROOT.GetAdjective] citizens.\n\nIf convicted, the penalty for these crimes would almost certainly be death by shooting."
 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.19.desc_4:0 "NKVD agents have uncovered a disturbing new conspiracy involving several members of our party. All the more worrying since, after several arrests and exhaustive interrogations, the names of several former Bolsheviks have come to light. Further investigation has revealed evidence that a number of these alleged conspirators had indeed been involved in acts of sabotage, factionalism and anti-[ROOT.GetAdjective] conduct. These men have been put on trial and are now awaiting the verdict. Judging by the charges against them, conviction will undoubtedly mean a very harsh sentence."
 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.21.desc:1 "As part of the investigations into [ROOT.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName] followers in the military, the NKVD has uncovered evidence that General [?ROOT.SOV_purged_character_for_loc.GetName] has, in the past, made several comments critical of Comrade [Root.GetLeader] and pointing out the great contributions that [ROOT.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName] made to the revolution during the civil war. During interrogation, [?ROOT.SOV_purged_character_for_loc.GetName] initially professed his admiration and loyalty to [ROOT.GetLeader], but eventually cracked and revealed that he had been contacted by [ROOT.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName] movement agents to form a counter-revolutionary cell inside the military, which would execute acts of sabotage against the [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] Army."
 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.28.desc:0 "Reports are pouring in of a wide-spread network of officers who are deeply critical of [Root.GetLeader]'s handling of military matters. Those arrested on charges of sedition, sabotage, and anti-[Root.GetAdjective] thinking are quick to reveal the names of others in the network during interrogation. While there have long been suspicions about the loyalty of Generals, this reveals that perhaps even the Majors and Colonels are not to be trusted."
 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.29.desc:0 "Evidence that there is a large network of [ROOT.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName] followers in the Army is quickly growing. Each day, the NKVD is arresting new suspects implicated in previous confessions. These people often in turn reveal the names of further co-conspirators. It will take time to track down all the Generals who are part of this conspiracy, but it is clear that the list below represents a significant fraction of it, whose guilt has been proven by their confessions."
 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.31.desc:1 "An officer in the staff of Admiral [?ROOT.SOV_purged_character_for_loc.GetName] has contacted the NKVD to report a number of suspicious activities. According to the officer, [?ROOT.SOV_purged_character_for_loc.GetName] was very warmly welcomed by naval officers during a recent port visit abroad and may have used this opportunity to pass on classified information to them. Furthermore, there has been evidence of [Root.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName] movement cells in several ports the Admiral visited, allowing him to conspire with [Root.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName] against the state if he wanted to."
 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.38.desc:0 "Following reports from political officers about unusual activities in the fleet, the NKVD has launched a full investigation and found evidence of a large network of officers who are deeply critical, indeed hostile, to [?country_leader.GetIdeologyGroup]. While most of them profess their loyalty to [Root.GetLeader] and [Root.GetNameDef], it is clear that they could easily be turned into spies by foreign agencies. Indeed, interrogation has revealed that several of them already have been in the employ of capitalist states to spy on us, and they are quickly revealing more names."
 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.39.desc:0 "The investigation into the [Root.UTI_lev_trotsky.GetName] movement center inside the military has clearly shown that it is particularly well-entrenched in the Navy. Most if not all of the Admirals in the Navy are deeply suspect, having had the opportunity to conspire with foreign elements while deployed abroad. So far, every higher-ranking Admiral arrested by the NKVD has confessed to very severe crimes, including espionage and sabotage, after only a few days of interrogation. With more and more Navy officers implicated in this conspiracy, it is clear that rooting it out will require a very thorough investigation."
