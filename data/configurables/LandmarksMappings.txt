# Building keys can be found in HoI4 /common/buildings/01_landmark_buildings.txt
# Unmapped buildings will not be output to the conversion mod
# Location represents the province ID where the landmark gets placed
# Original locations are defined inside /history/states in the corresponding state file
# or the NF that builds the landmark if it's unbuilt
# Built entry defines if the landmark will show up as built in the conversion
# By default, landmarks assigned in HoI4 /history/states are built
