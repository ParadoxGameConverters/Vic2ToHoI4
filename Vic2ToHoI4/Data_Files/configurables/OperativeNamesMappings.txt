# Codename operatives mappings
# Countries that had names in vanilla will use those (Germany will always use German operatives, even if they became e.g. Ashkenazi)
# These mappings have this structure:
# link = { codenames = [Operative List] culture = [Primary culture] }
# The Operative List is the one indicated in /common/units/codenames_operatives/[text file].txt as the first non-commented line
# The Primary culture is, of course, from Vic2
# In case a country has no vanilla operative names nor culture-assigned ones, it will default to the generic operative names
# Hopefully, one day we'll have specific name lists for all cultures but, until then, bear with us that your horse agent is called James Bond
