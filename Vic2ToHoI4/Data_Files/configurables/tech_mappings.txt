# Notes:
# - Each V2 tech and invention is linked to zero or more HoI tech levels.
# - More than one V2 tech or invention may grant a given HoI tech level.
# - If a higher level is earned, it will be granted even if the lower level was not earned.
# - Limits can use C++-style string literals (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/string_literal) to include quotes
