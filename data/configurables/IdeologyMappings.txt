# Mappings for determining ideological support for HoI4 countries.
#	In a country ruled by the specified HoI4 ideology, the Vic2 ideology will become the supported ideology.

# Each mapping has the following elements:
#	ruling_ideology (required) - the ideology ruling the country in HoI4.
#	vic2_ideology (required) - the Vic2 ideology.
#	supported_ideology (required) - the ideology given support in HoI4.

# All possible combinations are represented.
