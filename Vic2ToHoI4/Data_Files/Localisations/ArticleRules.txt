# How this file works:
# Let's take the localization of a given country, let's tag it ABC
# And let's choose to take the localisation it has in French
# If this localisation starts with "Le " or "L'" or one of those others,
# for this example, let's say the localisation is "Les Habitants",
# the converter will remove the article accordingly, yielding
# ABC as "Habitants" and ABC_DEF as "Les Habitants".

# Language: self-explanatory
# Matcher: use it to tell what is an article.
#    (.+) means "the rest of the localisation" and must NEVER be forgotten
# Replacement: how the name should be with no article,
#    using $1 to mean "the things that were in the matcher as (.+)"

# Hopefully the matcher is case-insensitive

## German "Die $1n $2" is a special thing for the USA
## Die [Vereinigte]n [Staaten] ==> [Vereinigte] [Staaten]
## Although I am unsure if it would work good with other stuff
## Der [Sudan] ==> [Sudan]; Die [Volksrepublik Kongo] ==> [Volksrepublik Kongo]
