# These mappings define how country names are assigned.
#
# For the specified HoI4 ideology, the name comes from the matching Vic2 government.
# A Vic2 tag can be required as well: name_mapping = { vic2_gov = democracy vic2_tag = TAG hoi4_ideology = democratic }
# This will ensure the rule is applied only to the matching country, allowing for customizations.
#
# The rules are scanned in order, and the first matching rule is the one that is applied.
# Only one of each item is valid within a rule. To have multiple matches, make multiple rules.
