Q: I used a mod, will the converter work with it?
A: It depends on what the mod changed. Your best bet is to simply try (and let us know how it went). As far as we can
   tell, it does work well with NNM, PDM, HPM, and games converted from EU4.

Q: What should I put it the Victoria 2 mod directory option?
