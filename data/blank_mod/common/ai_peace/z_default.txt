# Default Logic behaviour that the AI will fallback on if no other fits the bill
# Should just be "good enough" to make sure the AI acts smart in the war
# Written by Henrik "Groogy" Hansson

#Adjustments
#Default AI (ie neutral AI) will act like a mix between democratic and fascist, but in general way more conservative and mostly interested in obtaining cores and the status quo. If they have enough warscore, they will puppet/liberate neighbors as well.
#Neutral AI in general do not directly annex other nations.
#The plan is to eventually make individualized AI for every country in the game.

# Temp variables
# Old actions will be stored as temp variables
# For Winners:
#	taken_states@TAG: an array where each element contains the state that is taken by country TAG
#	taken_by@STATE_ID: is set to country that took the state
# For Losers:
# 	current_states@TAG: Remaining states of loser
# For each subject action:
#   subject_states@TAG : an array where each element contains the state that is subjected by country TAG
#   subject_countries@TAG : an array where each element contains the country that is subjected by country TAG
#   subjected_by@STATE_ID : a variable for each state that is subjected by a country, value is overlord
#   subjected_by@TAG : an array for each loser that is subjected, array contains overlord
# For each liberated:
#   liberate_states@TAG : an array where each element contains the state that is liberated by country TAG
#   liberate_countries@TAG : an array where each element contains the country that is liberated by country TAG
# A trigger named "build_temp_vars" will be called before any evaluation so further temp variables can be calculated
