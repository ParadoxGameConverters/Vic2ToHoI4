 SOV_the_stalin_constitution:0 "The Stalin Constitution"
 SOV_the_stalin_constitution_desc:0 "The constitution of 1924 was a good attempt at organizing a state following the Civil War, but it has served its purpose. A new constitution is needed. Primarily, we much acknowledge the tireless work of Comrade Stalin in keeping the Union strong and safe and whose genius and wisdom has been instrumental in leading the cause of communism forward."
 SOV_the_zinovyevite_terrorist_center:0 "The Zinovyevite Terrorist Center"
 SOV_the_zinovyevite_terrorist_center_desc:0 "The assassination of Comrade Kirov in 1934 shows that there are members of the party who are clearly plotting against Comrade Stalin and the Union as a whole. We have obtained confessions from several co-conspirators, implicating several more people. This Zinovyevite plot - no doubt organised by Trotsky or western agents, possibly working together - must be cut out, like a cancer, before it spreads."
 SOV_will_trigger_a_great_purge_tt:0 "Stalin will start a Great Purge. §RThis purge will not be avoidable.§!"

 SOV_secure_the_administration_desc:0 "With the shock of the confessions of the terrorist Zinovyev and his allies, we must ask questions about the loyalties of other members of the party. It is imperative that we know where each member of the Politbureau stands."
 SOV_the_collectivization_process_desc:0 "While a lot of work remains to be done, and though it has been badly misshandled in some regions, the process of collectivizing the farms in the Soviet Union is almost complete, and will soon yield increased production from the agricultural sector."
 SOV_the_anti_soviet_trotskyist_center:0 "The Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center"
 SOV_the_anti_soviet_trotskyist_center_desc:0 "Our investigation into the Zinovyevite plot has revealed that there is a large network of anti-soviet terrorists in our administration. Some members are not even fully aware of who they are helping! This conspiracy must be rooted out, and drastic measures may have to be taken to achieve this."
 SOV_the_workers_dictatorship_desc:0 "All power in our Union must ultimately rest with the workers. We can not afford to splinter into factionalism, and must therefore ensure that the will of the workers is always expressed in the decisions of the Politbureau."
 SOV_organization_centralization_discipline_desc:0 "In this time of uncertainty, the people look to the Politbureau for stability and guidance. We must ensure that this organ of decision making is not only supportive of, but united behind, the decisions of Comrade Stalin."
 SOV_the_military_conspiracy_desc:0 "The Trotskist plot in our country has reached the military. We now have evidence that leading Generals and even Marshalls have conspired with foreign intelligence services to overthrow the government! We can not allow officers whose loyalties are even mildly suspect to remain in positions where they can weaken our military even further."
 SOV_the_bloc_of_rights_and_trotskyites:0 "The Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites"
 SOV_the_bloc_of_rights_and_trotskyites_desc:0 "At last, we have reached the very heart of the conspiracy in our midst. Nikolai Bukharin was in fact a member of the Trotskist-Zinovievite bloc, and was most likely the leader of the people inside the government who attempted to execute a counter-revolution. We now have irrefutable proof of this, and in one last trial, we can expose these facts to the light."
 SOV_behead_the_snake_desc:0 "It has become absolutely clear that the Union will not be safe until the threat of a Trotskist coup is fully banished. While it would be good to put Trotsky on trial to expose his anti-soviet activities, we do not have that luxury. Our only option is to assassinate him, to deprive the plot against the government of its leader and prime instigator."

 SOV_stalins_cult_of_personality:0 "Stalin's Cult of Personality"
 SOV_stalins_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "Following the exposure of the shocking plot against the Union, it is obvious that it was only Comrade Stalin's clear-sighted leadership that prevented a descent into civil war or worse. Every single Soviet citizen, and indeed every member of the global working class, owes Comrade Stalin eternal gratitude for his tireless work in defending the revolution."
 SOV_they_will_know_fear_desc:0 "Our enemies have learned to fear the Red Army and the Soviet people. We have withstood the initial onslaught and it is time to fight back. We need to develop fearsome new war machines capable of breaking through even the most fortified enemy defensive lines. Such war machines must drive terror to the very heart of the enemy by merely being named..."
 SOV_inheritor_of_the_mantle_of_lenin_desc:1 "Comrade Stalin has always been Lenin's closest companion and most trusted disciple. As the most faithful follower of Lenin's teachings, it is only natural that he should inherit the heavy duty of guiding the nation towards Communism as well as preparing for the inevitable global worker's revolution."

There can be no better man to execute that vision than Comrade Stalin, who was with Lenin every step of the way and who now stands ready to deliver the promise that was made in the revolution."
 SOV_ban_excessive_hero_worship_desc:0 "There has been a trend of publishing fanciful and wildly exaggerated accounts of Comrade Stalin's private life and his childhood. However well-intentioned, these accounts are counter-revolutionary and seek to establish a cult of heroism in the minds of the Soviet people, and seeks to replace a vigorous study of the theories of Comrade Stalin with mere blind idolatry."
 SOV_leader_of_the_party_and_the_people_desc:0 "Comrade Stalin has performed his heavy tasks with dilligence and skill, and enjoys the unreserved and undivided support of both the party and the people. Any hint of vanity or self-adulation is foreign to him; he is perhaps the most humble person alive."
 SOV_great_commander_desc:0 "The accomplishments of Comrade Stalin in military theory and leadership are too many to list. While the traitor Trotsky may have founded the Red Army, it was Comrade Stalin who turned it into an effective force to defend the accomplishments of the working class."
 SOV_architect_of_communism_desc:0 "Comrade Stalin's unwavering commitment to the ideals of the revolution have enabled him to see the challenges of building Socialism in One Country. With the work towards building Socialism well underway, he can turn towards the next big step: how to move from Socialism to full Communism."
 SOV_father_of_nations_desc:0 "Our Union is a great family of many different people, and every family needs a head. Comrade Stalin is that head, who ensures that its many children are educated in Socialist thought and who guides our efforts towards a bright future.

 SOV_moscow_trial_real_name:0 "[GetMoscowTrialIndex] Moscow Trial"
 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.01.desc:0 "In a recent session of the Central Committee, Comrade [Root.GetLeader] noted the growing factionalism inside the party. While all members of the committee were quick to assure him of their full and unconditional support, this has apparently done very little to ease his concerns. According to Comrade [Root.GetLeader], we must always be vigilant for saboteurs and wreckers who plot against the state, in whatever position they may be.\n\nThis news comes as a bit of a surprise to many in the party, who believed that the threat of a party split ended with Trotsky's exile."
 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.19.desc_1:0 "The investigation into the murder of Comrade Kirov in 1934 has uncovered a lot of leads that point towards a conspiracy between Zinoviev and Trotsky. Following a series of arrests and interrogations, the evidence has only grown more substantial. \n\nAfter a meeting with [Root.GetLeader], Zinoviev and Kamenev have at last confessed to working with Trotsky to overthrow the government, assassinate Soviet leaders and ultimately restore capitalism in the Soviet Union. They are now put on trial with 14 of their co-conspirators. The charges against them weigh heavy - a conviction would mean certain death."
 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.19.desc_2:0 "Following the trial of the first group of Trotskyists and terrorists, investigations by the NKVD have continued and uncovered more evidence. Karl Radek was arrested and eventually cracked during interrogation. He has revealed the existence of a wide-spread network of people fully or partially working with Trotsky in practically all areas of government, including the military. The ringleaders have already been arrested and confessed under interrogation.\n\nThese ringleaders, including Radek, are now on trial. Their crimes are less than the ones charged in the last trial - but the death penalty is certainly a possibility."
 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.19.desc_3:0 "The investigations before the Second Moscow Trial also revealed a large network of Trotskyists in the military and upper party leadership, led by Bukharin. These people have been arrested and interrogated, where they have confessed to the most serious and heinous of crimes - from planned sabotage to attempted assassination, conspiring with foreign powers and even mixing nails into butter to injure or kill regular Soviet citizens.\n\nIf convicted, the penalty for these crimes would almost certainly be death by shooting."
 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.19.desc_4:0 "NKVD agents have uncovered a disturbing new conspiracy involving several members of our party. All the more worrying since, after several arrests and exhaustive interrogations, the names of several former Bolsheviks have come to light. Further investigation has revealed evidence that a number of these alleged conspirators had indeed been involved in acts of sabotage, factionalism and anti-soviet conduct. These men have been put on trial and are now awaiting the verdict. Judging by the charges against them, conviction will undoubtedly mean a very harsh sentence."
 NSB_soviet_paranoia_system_events.29.desc:0 "Evidence that there is a large Trotskyist network in the Army is quickly growing. Each day, the NKVD is arresting new suspects implicated in previous confessions. These people often in turn reveal the names of further co-conspirators. It will take time to track down all the Generals who are part of this conspiracy, but it is clear that the list below represents a significant fraction of it, whose guilt has been proven by their confessions."

 SOV_purged_junior_army_officers_1_desc:1 "A significant number of junior Army officers have been arrested by the NKVD on charges of sedition, sabotage, and anti-soviet thinking. The loss of so many experienced officers and veterans from past wars has left the Red Army in dangerous disarray."
