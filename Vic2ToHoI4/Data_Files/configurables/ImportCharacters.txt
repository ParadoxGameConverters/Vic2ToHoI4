# This file can be used to add characters to the conversion mod. If a character is a country leader it will override
# the generated country leader with the same ideology in the specified country. However, you can still add multiple
# leaders for different ideologies.
#
# You will need to add extra localizations for them in blankMod. If you use portraits not included in the base game or
# the converter you will need to add them to blankMod.
#
# Add characters to the file like so:
#
# USA={
#	USA_abraham_lincoln={
#		name = USA_abraham_lincoln
#		portraits={
#			civilian={
#				large="gfx/leaders/USA/portrait_usa_abraham_lincoln.dds"
#			}
#		}
#		country_leader={
#			ideology=liberalism
#			traits={ the_great_emancipator }
#			expire="1953.1.1.12"
#			id=-1
#		}
#	}
# }
